# ![Logo](https://github.com/sherifelkhatib/Android-Image-Helper/raw/master/sample/res/drawable-mdpi/ic_launcher.png) Media Helper for Android

This project aims to provide an easy-to-use instrument for android developers to use when they need the user to select an image or video on their android phone and upload it.
If the process has any errors on specific phones, these should be handled inside the library to provide the same user experience on all phones.
